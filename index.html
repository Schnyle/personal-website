              Analyzed data from aircraft measuring natural/greenhouse gas leaks and produced reports for customers; assisted in developing measurement system for drones; traveled to the field with aircraft to make measurements. Wrote software which increased the scientific confidence in the company’s product as well as made the aircraft pilots’ jobs easier and therefore safer. Was a primary contributor to a project with drones which in part involved pencil-to-paper mathematics, physics, learning new software, thorough analysis of data, and troubleshooting various software problems relating to drones.
